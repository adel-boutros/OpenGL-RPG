OpenGL-RPG
==========

RPG created using openGL for a open 3D course in ENSIMAG.
This project meant to introduce to the basics of OpenGL and what could be done with it
(skybox, textures, light rendering, shadows, particles, animation structures, ...) 
But this is far from being a finished project...

To Play
-------

- Z Q S D    : moving
- espace     : jump
- A          : change point of view
- right clic : fire an energie bolt
- P          : screenshot
- escape     : quit

(you can change the field of view by changing the last number in the constructor of "carte" in game_engine.cpp)

Actual status
-------------

- water transparency doesn't work anymore (broke it fixing textures)
- texture on the character should be changed (unless it become a concept)
- strange colors bug on the shadow zones ...
